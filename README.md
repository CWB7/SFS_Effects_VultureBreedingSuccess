# SFS_Effects_VultureBreedingSuccess
Supplementary feeding has become a popular, yet still debated, conservation tool to mitigate Old World vulture declines.

Supplementary feeding has become a popular, yet still debated, conservation tool to mitigate Old World vulture declines. This intervention is proposed to support 
vulture numbers by increasing various demographic parameters but such effects have seldom been verified. I used monitoring data on ten South African Cape Vulture 
colonies spanning over two decades, to model the relationship between supplementary feeding sites within a 100 or 200 km radius and breeding success. 

In this analysis I aim to assess 1) the relationship between breeding success at the colony level and the amount of food provided at nearby SFS, 2) whether SFS in closer proximity to 
vulture colonies are more beneficial, 3) whether poor management practice of not screening carcasses for Pb-contamination may have negative effects on vulture breeding 
success, 4) whether estimated poisoning prevalence by commercial farmers in the vicinity of colonies may have negative effects on vulture breeding success. I predict 
that higher provisioning rates and the proximity of SFS to colonies will increase breeding success and that both higher potential poisoning prevalence and higher 
potential amounts of Pb contaminated food provisioning will decrease breeding success.

The data can unfortuanately not be shared at this time.

Please not that the code is still in the process of being cleaned up but has been published as it may assist others doing similar analysis.
